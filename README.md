# Simple Blockchain Implementation

## Overview
This project is a simple representation of a blockchain using Python as the programming language. It includes facility to assemble blocks and append transactions, to mine the blocks and to check the properties of the resultant Blockchain. The code is always made to introduce significant blockchain concepts including the proof of work, hashing and also transaction.

## Features
- **Block and Blockchain Classes**: Scalability through a moduli use of the procedures under consideration.
- **Transactions**: Integrate it and manage new and existing transactions within blocks of code.
- **Mining**: Public consensus network protocol with a built-in proof-of-work feature and an objective level of difficulty.
- **Integrity Validation**: Use the blockchain to identify attempts at modifying it.
- **Genesis Block**: Is designed to use a computational function in order to construct the first block of the blockchain.

## Prerequisites
1. Python 3.x or a later version installed out there in the system.
2. There are no additional libraries, all existing libraries are Pythonâ€™s built-in functions such as `hashlib`, `time`, `json`, and `random` and so on.
